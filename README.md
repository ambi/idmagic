# IdMagic

**A compact identity provider for serious protocol experiments.**

IdMagic is a Go-based Identity Provider for experimenting with OAuth 2.0,
OpenID Connect, SAML, WS-Federation, tenant isolation, application portals, and
identity administration. It is built with Regenerative Architecture practices:
the durable product model lives in SCL, architectural reasoning lives in ADRs,
and implementation is kept close to bounded contexts.

The project is useful as a readable reference implementation, a protocol lab,
and a foundation for identity platform experiments.

## Highlights

- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authorization server with PKCE, PAR, device flow,
  token introspection, revocation, dynamic client registration, DPoP,
  `private_key_jwt`, refresh-token rotation, and userinfo.
- Enterprise federation surface: SAML 2.0 IdP, WS-Federation passive profile,
  WS-Trust username/mixed STS, federation metadata, and Microsoft Entra domain
  federation presets.
- Multi-tenant identity model with realm-scoped routes, per-tenant signing keys,
  admin console, account portal, groups, roles, application catalog, consent
  management, audit views, and per-tenant hosted login/account branding.
- Adapter-oriented runtime: in-memory local mode, PostgreSQL, Valkey, Kafka
  outbox relay, OpenTelemetry, SMTP, AuthZEN, and Vault Transit signing.
- React admin/account/auth UI built with Vite, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS,
  Radix UI, and local shadcn-style components.
- SCL-first documentation flow: canonical specification in `spec/`, ADRs in
  `decisions/`, and change records in `work-items/`.

## Quick Start

Run the Docker-free local stack with embedded PostgreSQL, a Valkey-compatible
development endpoint, the API, worker, and UI:

```bash
just dev
```

The first run downloads and caches an embedded PostgreSQL binary (about 190 MB).
Development data is temporary and is removed when the stack stops. The API and
worker remain separate processes and share the PostgreSQL job queue, so durable
jobs such as CSV user import work in this mode. The local endpoints are
`127.0.0.1:55432` (PostgreSQL) and `127.0.0.1:56379` (Valkey-compatible).

For the smallest API + UI loop, without durable jobs or the background worker:

```bash
just dev-memory
```

Open <http://localhost:5173/> and choose the local demo authentication entry.
Use:

| User | Password | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alice` | `demo-password-1234` | tenant admin demo user |
| `root` | `demo-password-1234` | tenant admin + system admin |

Do not open `/login` directly. The login screen expects an active
authorization transaction.

### CSV user import

Tenant administrators can submit UTF-8 CSV files to `POST /api/admin/users/imports`
with `mode` set to `dry_run` or `apply`. The required header is
`preferred_username,email,name,roles`; roles are `|` separated. Files are limited
to 1 MiB, 1,000 rows, and 64 KiB per field. Password material is never accepted;
imported users are required to set a password on first sign-in. CSV jobs require
the standard `just dev` or `just dev-compose`; they are unavailable in
`just dev-memory`.

### Dynamic groups

Tenant administrators can create either manual groups or CEL-based dynamic groups.
Dynamic rules are boolean expressions over the `user` object, for example
`user.department == "Engineering" && user.email.endsWith("@example.com")`.
Attribute names come from the tenant user-attribute schema; string comparison is
case-sensitive unless the rule explicitly applies `lowerAscii()`. The supported
surface is intentionally restricted to boolean/comparison operators, list macros,
safe string helpers, timestamps, and bounded regular expressions.

Dynamic memberships are exclusive from manual membership changes. Rule edits and
enabling enqueue a full reconciliation job, while a single user's attribute or
lifecycle change is evaluated synchronously. Memberships carry the rule version;
stale versions never contribute roles or application assignments. Evaluation errors
fail closed, and an attribute referenced by a stored rule cannot be deleted or have
its type changed until the rule is updated.

### Manual Local Run

If you prefer separate terminals, start shared PostgreSQL/Valkey yourself and
provide `PERSISTENCE=postgres_valkey`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `VALKEY_URL` to both
the API and worker. `just dev-api` by itself continues to use memory mode.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Go API
WEBAUTHN_RP_ID=localhost \
WEBAUTHN_RP_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173 \
ADDR=:8081 \
ISSUER=http://localhost:5173 \
just dev-api

# Terminal 2: React UI
just dev-ui
```

## Docker Development Stack

The compose stack starts PostgreSQL, Valkey, Redpanda/Kafka, OpenTelemetry
Collector, Prometheus, the Go API, the UI gateway, and the outbox relay. Caddy
exposes the combined app at <http://localhost:8080/>. Prometheus scrapes the
Go API's `/metrics` directly on the compose network (`infra/docker/prometheus.yml`);
it is deliberately not proxied through Caddy — see
[Metrics (`/metrics`)](#metrics-metrics) below. Browse Prometheus at
<http://localhost:9090/>. `infra/docker/prometheus-rules.yml` (recording +
SLO burn-rate alert rules) and `infra/docker/grafana-dashboard.json` (a
minimal panel set) are built only from the metric catalog above; wi-11
(Kubernetes/monitoring assets) turns them into cluster
PrometheusRule/ServiceMonitor/dashboard provisioning.

```bash
just dev-compose
```

Re-apply only the declarative PostgreSQL schema:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.dev.yaml run --rm schema
```

Run the OAuth/OIDC demo script against the compose stack:

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:8080 ./demo.sh
```

## Common Commands

This repository uses `just` as the command map:

```bash
just --list
just setup
just verify
just dev
just dev-memory
just dev-api
just dev-ui
just dev-compose
```

Useful checks:

```bash
just verify-go
just verify-ui
just test-ui-e2e
```

## UI display languages

The hosted authentication, account, and admin UI support Japanese (`ja`) and English (`en`) only.
English is the product default. Set `VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE=ja` or `VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en` at
application startup to choose the final fallback when neither an explicit nor a browser locale is
available; an unset or invalid value falls back to English.
Add user-visible copy to the dictionary that is local to its feature (for example,
`frontend/src/features/auth-flow/LoginPage.i18n.ts`) and provide both locale values in
the same change. Use `defineDictionary` so TypeScript rejects missing or extra keys;
run `just verify-ui` before committing. Do not add another locale without a separately
specified product decision. Translate only stable backend error codes in the receiving
UI dictionary; render an unknown backend message unchanged, because backend error text
is intentionally English-only.

## Configuration

Local defaults use in-memory persistence and console email output. Production
adapters are selected with environment variables:

| Variable | Values | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PERSISTENCE` | `memory`, `postgres_valkey` | storage backend |
| `DATABASE_URL` | connection string | PostgreSQL database connection |
| `VALKEY_URL` | connection string | Valkey connection for volatile state |
| `EVENT_SINK` | `console`, `outbox` | domain event destination |
| `KAFKA_BROKERS` | broker list | outbox relay broker list |
| `OBSERVABILITY` | `noop`, `otel` | OpenTelemetry tracing/metrics |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | endpoint URL | OTLP/HTTP collector endpoint |
| `AUTHZEN` | `local`, `remote` | authorization policy mode |
| `AUTHZEN_URL` | remote policy service URL | remote authorization policy endpoint |
| `EMAIL_SENDER` | `console`, `smtp` | password reset and notification delivery |
| `KEY_PROVIDER` | `local`, `vault` | signing key provider |

| `BREACHED_PASSWORD_CHECKER` | `noop`, `hibp` | breached password checker |
| `REQUEST_ID_TRUST_INBOUND` | `false`, `true` | reuse an edge proxy's inbound `X-Request-ID` (see Request Correlation) |
| `HSTS_ENABLED` | `false`, `true` | emit `Strict-Transport-Security` (only when TLS is terminated at/ahead of this hop; see Security Response Headers) |
| `HSTS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | `31536000` | HSTS `max-age` when enabled |
| `HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS` | `true`, `false` | add `includeSubDomains` to HSTS |
| `CSP_REPORT_ONLY` | `false`, `true` | send CSP as `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` for staged rollout |
| `CSP_REPORT_URI` | URL/path | CSP `report-uri` for violation collection |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` | domain, e.g. `localhost` | WebAuthn relying-party ID; WebAuthn/passkeys are disabled when unset |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_ORIGINS` | comma-separated origins | Allowed browser origins for WebAuthn ceremonies, e.g. `http://localhost:5173` |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_DISPLAY_NAME` | display name | WebAuthn relying-party display name shown by authenticators |
| `SEED_PROFILE` | `bootstrap`, `development`, `test`, `performance` | explicit startup seed profile; unset by default |
| `SEED_ENVIRONMENT` | `development`, `test`, `staging`, `production` | required when `SEED_PROFILE` is set |
| `SEED_FIRST_PARTY_REDIRECT_URIS` | comma-separated HTTPS URIs | required for production bootstrap first-party clients; localhost is rejected |
| `SEED_GENERATOR_SEED` | arbitrary string | deterministic namespace for performance seed identifiers |

### Environment seed profiles

Seed は server 起動時には既定で実行されない。plan/apply は `just seed <environment> <profile> <mode>`
で明示する。`just dev` / `just dev-memory` だけは、ローカル利用のため development profile を明示して
同一プロセスで適用する。

| Profile | Allowed environments | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bootstrap` | development / test / staging / production | first-party client の最小設定。production では `SEED_FIRST_PARTY_REDIRECT_URIS` が必須。 |
| `development` | development / test / staging | local demo user、group、protocol sample、application。 |
| `test` | test | development と同じ決定的 fixture。 |
| `performance` | development / test / staging | 決定的 synthetic user。通常は 10,000 件まで、超過は `--allow-large` が必要。 |

`just seed development development dry_run` で変更計画を確認してから、末尾を `apply` にして投入する。
seed の出力は logical key と件数だけで、password・client secret・TOTP secret・hash・PII 全量を含まない。
旧 `SKIP_DEMO_SEED` は廃止されたため、起動時にデモ投入を止める設定は不要である。既存環境で
demo seed が既にある場合も、同じ development profile の apply は意味比較を行い、手動変更は conflict として保持する。

性能 profile は通常の検証に含めない。小さな件数を `just seed development performance apply` として使い、
計測時だけ `just seed-throughput development 10000 250` を実行する。10,000 件を超える場合は CLI の
`--allow-large` を明示し、100,000 件を超える値は拒否される。

### Tenant Branding

Tenant admins can customize the hosted login / consent / device / account
portal surfaces from Admin Console → Settings → Branding (ADR-096): product
name, logo, favicon, primary/accent colors, a support link, a legal link, and
footer text. This is intentionally a *safe subset*, not a general theming
system:

- Colors are limited to two `#rrggbb` tokens injected only as CSS custom
  properties (`--tenant-brand-primary` / `--tenant-brand-accent`); arbitrary
  CSS/HTML/JS is never accepted. Any value in that format can be saved; each
  tenant is responsible for choosing a readable color combination.
- Links (support / legal) accept `https://` only; other schemes
  (`javascript:`, `data:`, plain `http://`) are rejected.
- Logo/favicon uploads reuse the same validated-blob pipeline as Application
  icons (ADR-073): PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF only, verified by magic byte (not file
  extension or declared content-type), 256 KiB max, no SVG. Delivery
  responses pin `Content-Type` and set `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- An unconfigured or partially-configured tenant falls back to IdMagic's
  default branding; a branding read failure never blocks the login endpoint.
- The admin console's own UI chrome is unaffected — only the public-facing
  hosted surfaces (`GET /api/branding`, `GET
  /tenant-branding-assets/{kind}/{object_key}`) read tenant branding.
  Email-template branding and custom CSS/HTML injection are out of scope.

### WebAuthn / Passkeys

WebAuthn binds passkeys to the browser origin and relying-party ID. For local
development, `localhost` is allowed by browsers over plain HTTP; non-local
deployments must use HTTPS and set `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` to the registrable domain
that users visit. `WEBAUTHN_RP_ORIGINS` must include every public origin used by
the UI, such as `https://login.example.com`. The Docker development stack sets
`WEBAUTHN_RP_ID=localhost` and `WEBAUTHN_RP_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080`.

For SMTP testing, Mailpit works well:

```bash
mailpit --smtp 127.0.0.1:1025 --listen 127.0.0.1:8025

EMAIL_SENDER=smtp \
SMTP_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
SMTP_PORT=1025 \
SMTP_TLS=none \
SMTP_FROM=noreply@idmagic.test \
./dev.sh
```

Open Mailpit at <http://127.0.0.1:8025/>.

### High Availability & Shared State

Running more than one replica requires the `postgres_valkey` runtime with a shared
Valkey (`PERSISTENCE=postgres_valkey`, `DATABASE_URL`, `VALKEY_URL`). All ephemeral /
short-lived state is then kept in a store shared across replicas rather than in
per-replica process memory:

- **Valkey** holds the authorization request / authorization code / PAR / device
  code / login session / DPoP & client-assertion replay guards / access-token
  denylist, and the **login brute-force throttle**.
- **PostgreSQL** owns the durable shared state: refresh tokens, audit events, and
  auth-event aggregation buckets.

The login throttle in particular *must* be shared: with per-replica counters an
attacker's failed attempts split across `N` replicas, so the per-account /
per-IP lockout thresholds (ADR-029) would effectively loosen up to `N×`
cluster-wide — a silent security regression. On the shared Valkey they are
counted cluster-wide with atomic increments, and the account / IP identifiers are
SHA-256 hashed so no plaintext username or IP is stored (ADR-077).

Because the throttle is on the critical path, its degradation is **fail-closed**:
if the shared store is unreachable, a login attempt whose throttle state cannot be
verified is rejected rather than let through (it never fails open into an
un-throttled state). Run Valkey in a highly-available configuration
(replication / failover) for multi-replica deployments so this path stays up.

The `memory` runtime keeps this state in process and is therefore **single-replica
/ test only** — do not run multiple replicas against it.

### Request Correlation (`X-Request-ID`)

Every request is assigned a `request_id`. It is returned in the `X-Request-ID`
response header and attached to every application log line for the request
(alongside `trace_id` / `span_id` when `OBSERVABILITY=otel`), so a single request
can be correlated across logs and with a client report.

Correlation-id generation belongs at the edge. Because `X-Request-ID` is
attacker-controllable, IdMagic is **secure by default**: it self-generates the id
and ignores any inbound `X-Request-ID`, so a directly reachable client cannot
spoof or collide correlation ids. Choose one of two setups:

- **Trusted edge proxy owns the header.** If a proxy in front of IdMagic
  generates (and thereby sanitizes) `X-Request-ID` for external traffic, set
  `REQUEST_ID_TRUST_INBOUND=true` so that id flows into IdMagic's logs — giving a
  single id shared across the proxy and application tiers. Only enable this when
  the proxy actually sets/regenerates the header; a proxy that passes the client
  value through untouched must not be trusted. Examples:
  - Envoy / Istio regenerate `x-request-id` at the edge by default.
  - nginx (≥ 1.11.0): `proxy_set_header X-Request-ID $request_id;`
  - Caddy v2: `reverse_proxy` with `header_up X-Request-ID {http.request.uuid}`
- **No proxy, or a proxy that cannot set the header.** Leave
  `REQUEST_ID_TRUST_INBOUND=false` (the default); IdMagic generates its own id and
  the inbound value is ignored. No proxy header configuration is required.

Regardless of the setting, a reused inbound value is sanitized (bounded length,
restricted character set) as defense in depth against header/log injection.

### Metrics (`/metrics`)

`GET /metrics` exposes Prometheus/OpenMetrics-format metrics (the
`MetricsExposition` interface, `spec/contexts/system.yaml`): HTTP RED (request
count, error rate via `status_code`, duration, in-flight) for every route
template, plus authentication golden signals for SLO/alerting:

| Metric | Labels | Verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`, `http_requests_in_flight` | `route`, `method`, `status_code` | per-interface latency/error-rate objectives (e.g. `oauth2.yaml` `TokenLatency`/`TokenErrorRate`, `authentication.yaml` `LoginLatency`/`LoginErrorRate`) |
| `authn_login_attempts_total` | `outcome`, `reason_class`, `method` | login success/failure golden signal (recorded once per confirmed decision, independent of audit-event aggregation under a credential-stuffing burst) |
| `authn_login_throttle_total` | `policy` (`account`/`ip`), `outcome` (`allowed`/`throttled`/`store_unavailable`) | login throttle hit rate |
| `oauth2_token_issuance_total`, `oauth2_token_issuance_duration_seconds` | `grant_type`, `outcome` | `/token` issuance rate/latency by grant |
| `http_request_aborts_total`, `operation_detached_completion_failures_total` | `kind` | `RequestFaultIsolation` / cancellation policy (ADR-074) |

Every label is a bounded, finite set (route templates, HTTP methods/status
codes, grant types, outcome/reason classes). `tenant_id`, `user_id`,
`client_id`, and resolved request paths are never labels — the endpoint is
scraped outside the tenant-resolution middleware and separated from the
application API for this reason. It is always registered but returns `503`
until the process finishes constructing its Prometheus registry at startup,
and works independently of `OBSERVABILITY` (OTLP tracing/push-metrics),
because a pull-based scrape needs no collector configured. Expose it only on
a loopback/management network, or in front of an authenticating proxy — never
on the public gateway.

### HTTP Server Hardening

The boundary HTTP server applies production-safe timeouts and a request body
limit so a single slow or oversized client cannot exhaust connections or memory
(`gosec G112` / CWE-400). Bodies over the limit are rejected with `413`. Defaults
are conservative and can be overridden per deployment:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HTTP_READ_HEADER_TIMEOUT` | `10s` | max time to read request headers (slowloris bound) |
| `HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | max time to read the full request |
| `HTTP_WRITE_TIMEOUT` | `60s` | max time to write the response |
| `HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `120s` | keep-alive idle connection timeout |
| `HTTP_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `1048576` | max request body size in bytes (1 MiB) |

This is defense in depth, not a substitute for an edge proxy. The **primary**
line against volumetric floods and TLS-handshake slowloris is the fronting
reverse proxy (Envoy / Nginx / Caddy / HAProxy), which sees total traffic and can
stop abuse cheaply at the edge. IdMagic still enforces its own timeouts and body
limit so it stays safe when run without a proxy, and so the proxy↔app hop and
any in-cluster direct access are covered. Tune the proxy's own timeouts and
connection limits alongside these values.

### Security Response Headers

Every backend response carries security headers applied by a boundary middleware
(ADR-076): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`,
`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and a strict `Content-Security-Policy`
(`default-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self'`).
`frame-ancestors 'none'` plus `X-Frame-Options: DENY` forbid framing so the
login / consent / portal surfaces cannot be clickjacked. The CSP does not use
`'unsafe-inline'`: the only inline script IdMagic renders is the fixed
auto-submit of the SAML ACS / WS-Fed POST-binding form, which is pinned by a
`script-src 'sha256-…'` hash on that response, and its `form-action` is narrowed
to the destination endpoint.

**Header ownership (app vs edge).** CSP and `frame-ancestors` require per-route
decisions and are owned by IdMagic so they hold even behind a minimal or absent
proxy (secure by default). The SPA is served by the gateway (see `frontend/Caddyfile`),
which sets its own `script-src 'self'` CSP for the static HTML — IdMagic's
middleware covers the backend responses the gateway reverse-proxies.

**HSTS is owned by the TLS terminator.** `Strict-Transport-Security` is off by
default so development over plain `http` is not poisoned. Enable it only when TLS
is terminated at or ahead of this hop:

- Terminating TLS at the edge proxy (typical): leave HSTS to the proxy, keep
  `HSTS_ENABLED=false`.
- Terminating TLS at/for the app, or wanting the app to assert it: set
  `HSTS_ENABLED=true` (tune `HSTS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` / `HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`).

**Staged rollout / reporting.** To tighten CSP without breaking a page, set
`CSP_REPORT_ONLY=true` to emit `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` and
`CSP_REPORT_URI=<url>` to collect violations, observe, then switch back to
enforce (`CSP_REPORT_ONLY=false`).

## Repository Map

```text
spec/             SCL source and generated specification artifacts

work-items/       planned and completed change records
backend/cmd/              process entry points

The main bounded contexts are `tenancy`, `idmanagement`,
`authentication`, `oauth2`, `application`, `wsfederation`, and `saml`.
Shared adapter code lives under `backend/shared`; runtime composition lives in
`backend/bootstrap`.

## Architecture

IdMagic follows Regenerative Architecture:

| Layer | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Specification Core | `spec/scl.yaml`, `spec/contexts/*.yaml` |
| Decisions | `decisions/*.md` |
| Application logic | `backend/<context>/domain`, `backend/<context>/usecases` |
| Ports and adapters | `backend/<context>/ports`, `backend/<context>/adapters`, `backend/shared/adapters` |
| Runtime and infrastructure | `backend/cmd/`, `backend/bootstrap`, `infra/`, `frontend/` |

Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) when changing code. It is the
small, stable index for navigating the implementation. Use the generated SCL
artifacts in `spec/` for the canonical product model, and ADRs for the reasoning
behind protocol and infrastructure choices.

## PostgreSQL Schema

`infra/schema/postgres.sql` is the declarative current-state schema. The app
does not run migrations on startup; deployment applies schema changes with
`psqldef`.

```bash
psqldef -U "$PGUSER" -h "$PGHOST" -p "$PGPORT" "$PGDATABASE" \
  --dry-run < infra/schema/postgres.sql

psqldef -U "$PGUSER" -h "$PGHOST" -p "$PGPORT" "$PGDATABASE" \
  --apply < infra/schema/postgres.sql
```

See [infra/schema/README.md](infra/schema/README.md) for the full workflow.

## Documentation Guide

## Lifecycle workflow operations

Lifecycle workflow runs are delivered at least once through the durable Jobs queue. A changed or no-op step is checkpointed and is not performed again when a Job retries. When a run reaches `failed` or `partially_failed`, an administrator may retry it from the workflow run detail; only failed steps return to pending.

Use dry-run before enabling a changed definition. It evaluates the selected user without creating a WorkflowRun, Job, membership, assignment, required action, status change, or email. Treat its result as a point-in-time prediction, not a guarantee of a later run.

If a run fails, inspect the sanitized step error code and the affected resource. Correct the external dependency or definition, then retry the run. Disabling a workflow prevents new triggers and cancels queued runs; it does not undo already completed actions.

- Product specification: [spec/scl.yaml](spec/scl.yaml)
- Implementation index: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

- PostgreSQL workflow: [infra/schema/README.md](infra/schema/README.md)
- Architecture decisions: [decisions/](decisions/)

When a change affects behavior, update SCL first, regenerate derived artifacts,
and keep README focused on the stable project overview.

## Build and Versioning

IdMagic supports injecting build version metadata at build time using Go `-ldflags`.

### Local Build via Just

You can inject a specific version when building locally by setting the `VERSION` environment variable:

```bash
VERSION=1.0.0 just build-go
```

If `VERSION` is not specified, it defaults to `0.0.0-dev`. The build process automatically extracts the current Git commit hash and build date, injecting them into the binary.

If the binary is built without `just` (e.g., direct `go build`), version metadata falls back to using Go's `runtime/debug.BuildInfo` (if VCS info is present in the build environment).

### Docker Build

You can pass the version metadata as build arguments:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg VERSION=1.0.0 \
  --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ') \
  -t idmagic:1.0.0 -f infra/docker/Dockerfile .
```

### Checking Active Version

The running version can be verified via:
1. **Startup Logs**: The server prints its version details on launch:
   `idmagic 1.0.0 (commit=..., date=...) listening on :8080`
